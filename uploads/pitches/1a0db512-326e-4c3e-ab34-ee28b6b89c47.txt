Transcript:
Kevin: Dr. Kumar, thank you for your time. I understand AeroSpace Dynamics is working on next-generation aircraft components with complex aerodynamic requirements.

Dr. Kumar: That's correct. Our current simulation processes take weeks to complete, and we're under pressure to reduce development cycles while maintaining safety standards.

Kevin: Llama 4's simulation optimizer can accelerate computational fluid dynamics and stress analysis by 10x while maintaining accuracy. Aerospace clients reduce design iteration time from weeks to days.

Dr. Kumar: How does it handle the complexity of aerospace regulations and safety requirements?

Kevin: The AI is trained on aerospace standards including FAA and EASA regulations. It flags potential compliance issues during design phases and maintains complete audit trails for certification processes.

Dr. Kumar: What about integration with our existing CAD and simulation tools?

Kevin: We integrate seamlessly with CATIA, SolidWorks, ANSYS, and most major aerospace platforms. The AI works as an enhancement layer, not a replacement.

Dr. Kumar: Security is critical given our defense contracts.

Kevin: Absolutely. We provide on-premise deployment options with air-gapped systems for classified work. All data remains under your control.

Dr. Kumar: Pricing structure?

Kevin: For your organization size and security requirements, $35K monthly with on-premise deployment. Implementation includes dedicated aerospace specialists.

Dr. Kumar: This aligns well with our Q2 efficiency initiatives. Let's schedule a technical evaluation with our engineering team.
