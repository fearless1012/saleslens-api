Context: MedTech needs to accelerate drug discovery through better data analysis.

Transcript:
David: Dr. Kim, thank you for your time. I understand MedTech is working on several promising compounds but facing delays in data analysis?

Dr. Kim: Exactly. We're sitting on massive datasets from clinical trials, but our current tools take weeks to generate meaningful insights. Time-to-market is critical in pharmaceuticals.

David: That's where Llama 4 excels. Our clinical AI can process complex biomedical data, identify patterns in patient responses, and predict trial outcomes. Novartis reduced their analysis time from 6 weeks to 3 days.

Dr. Kim: Three days? That would be transformative. But we deal with sensitive patient data - what about compliance?

David: Excellent question. We're HIPAA compliant, FDA validated, and use federated learning so your data never leaves your environment. We also provide full audit trails for regulatory submissions.

Dr. Kim: This could accelerate our Alzheimer's drug program significantly. What's the timeline for implementation?

David: For your use case, 4-6 weeks including model training on your historical data. We'd start with your current Alzheimer's trial data as a proof of concept.

Dr. Kim: I want to present this to our board next week. Can you prepare a detailed proposal?

David: Absolutely. I'll have a comprehensive proposal including ROI projections by Thursday.
