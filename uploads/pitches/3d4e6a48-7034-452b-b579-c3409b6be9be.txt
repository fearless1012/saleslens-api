Context: Engineering team overwhelmed with code reviews causing deployment bottlenecks.

Transcript:
Lauren: Carlos, I heard TechStream is scaling rapidly. How is your engineering team handling the increased code review workload?

Carlos: It's becoming a serious bottleneck. Our senior developers are spending 60% of their time on code reviews instead of building new features. We're missing deadlines.

Lauren: That's exactly what Llama 4's code review AI addresses. It handles the initial review for common issues - security vulnerabilities, style violations, performance problems - so your seniors can focus on architecture and complex logic.

Carlos: Interesting. But code review is about more than catching bugs. It's knowledge transfer and maintaining code quality standards.

Lauren: Absolutely. Our AI doesn't replace human review, it augments it. Think of it as a super-thorough junior developer that catches the obvious issues first. Your seniors still review the important stuff, but they're not wasting time on formatting errors.

Carlos: That could be valuable. What about false positives? We can't have the AI blocking good code.

Lauren: Great question. It starts in advisory mode - flagging potential issues but not blocking deployments. As it learns your codebase and standards, you can gradually increase its authority for certain types of issues.

Carlos: How long does training take?

Lauren: About two weeks to analyze your existing codebase and learn your patterns. Most teams see a 40% reduction in review time within the first month.

Carlos: That would free up significant senior developer time. Let's schedule a technical demo with my lead architects.

Lauren: Perfect. I'll set that up for next week.
