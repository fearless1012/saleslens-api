Transcript:
Jessica: Robert, I understand GlobalTech is struggling to scale your hiring process effectively?

Robert: Yes, we're hiring 200+ people this quarter, but our current process is manual and time-consuming. However, I have serious concerns about AI in hiring.

Jessica: I appreciate your caution. Bias in hiring AI is a real issue. Llama 4 is specifically designed with fairness algorithms and bias detection. We actually help reduce human bias in the process.

Robert: That's what every AI vendor says. But we've seen headlines about discriminatory algorithms. Our legal team is very nervous about this.

Jessica: Completely understandable. We provide full transparency - you can see exactly why the AI made each recommendation. Plus, we offer bias audits and comply with all EEOC guidelines.

Robert: The technology might be sound, but the optics are challenging. If there's any hint of discrimination, it could be a PR nightmare. Our CEO is very risk-averse on this topic.

Jessica: What if we focused only on initial resume screening to save your team time, with all final decisions remaining human-driven?

Robert: Even that feels risky. I think we need to stick with our current process for now. Maybe in a few years when AI hiring is more accepted, but not today.

Jessica: I understand completely. Your caution is actually admirable in this space.
