Transcript:
Emily: Linda, thanks for meeting with me. I know FreshFoods is exploring dynamic pricing solutions to stay competitive with online retailers.

Linda: Exactly. We're losing margin to e-commerce platforms that adjust prices in real-time. We need to be more agile.

Emily: Llama 4's pricing optimizer analyzes competitor prices, demand patterns, inventory levels, and customer behavior to recommend optimal pricing every hour. Grocery clients typically see 12-15% margin improvement.

Linda: We're also talking with PriceGenius and FlexiPrice. How do you differentiate?

Emily: Great question. Unlike static algorithms, Llama 4 learns from your specific customer base and local market conditions. It considers factors like weather, local events, and shopping patterns unique to each store.

Linda: That's interesting. What about implementation complexity?

Emily: We integrate with your existing POS systems and provide real-time dashboard monitoring. Setup takes 3-4 weeks per location.

Linda: Pricing structure?

Emily: $2K per store monthly, so for your 45 locations, $90K monthly.

Linda: I appreciate the presentation, but PriceGenius came in at $65K for similar functionality. Unless you can match that, we'll likely go with them.

Emily: Let me discuss with my manager about potential flexibility on pricing and get back to you tomorrow.
