Transcript:
Michael: Susan, thank you for your time. I know EduTech is focused on improving student success rates and engagement in online learning environments.

Susan: Absolutely. We're seeing high dropout rates in our courses, and engagement metrics show students struggling with one-size-fits-all content. We need more personalized approaches.

Michael: Llama 4's education module analyzes student learning patterns, engagement data, and comprehension levels to create personalized learning paths. EdTech platforms typically see 35% improvement in course completion and 50% better learning outcomes.

Susan: How does it handle different learning styles and skill levels within the same course?

Michael: The AI adapts content difficulty, pacing, and presentation style for each student. It identifies when students are struggling and provides additional resources or alternative explanations automatically.

Susan: What about instructor insights? Our teachers need to understand how students are progressing.

Michael: Excellent point. Instructors receive detailed analytics dashboards showing individual and class-wide progress, common struggle points, and recommended interventions.

Susan: Integration with our existing LMS platform?

Michael: We integrate with major platforms including Canvas, Blackboard, and Moodle. Students and instructors see personalized features seamlessly within their familiar interface.

Susan: Pricing structure for our student base?

Michael: $2 per active student per month, so costs scale with your growth. Implementation includes instructor training and ongoing support.

Susan: That's very reasonable. We serve about 50,000 active students, so $100K monthly fits our budget projections.

Michael: Perfect. I'll prepare implementation timeline and training schedule. We can have pilot courses running within 4 weeks.

Susan: Let's proceed. This could be exactly what we need to improve our student outcomes.
