Customer: Robert Kim, Operations Director at PowerGrid Electric Utility
Sales Rep: Hannah Davis
Product: Llama 4 AI Model - Energy Grid Optimization & Demand Forecasting
Call Result: Lost Sale - Regulatory Complexity
Context: PowerGrid manages electrical distribution and needs better demand prediction and grid optimization.

Transcript:
Hannah: Robert, thank you for meeting with me. I understand PowerGrid is working to modernize grid operations and improve demand forecasting accuracy.

Robert: Yes, we're dealing with increasing demand variability from renewable sources, electric vehicles, and changing consumption patterns. Our current forecasting is often off by 10-15%.

Hannah: Llama 4's grid optimization analyzes weather patterns, historical consumption, economic indicators, and real-time grid data to predict demand with 95% accuracy. Utilities typically reduce peak load costs by 20% and improve grid stability.

Robert: How does it handle renewable energy integration? Wind and solar are unpredictable.

Hannah: The AI incorporates weather forecasting, solar irradiance predictions, and wind patterns to optimize the mix of traditional and renewable sources. It can predict renewable output 48 hours in advance.

Robert: What about emergency situations and grid failures?

Hannah: Excellent question. The system can rapidly reconfigure power flows during outages, identify alternative routing options, and prioritize critical infrastructure during emergencies.

Robert: Integration complexity with our existing SCADA systems?

Hannah: We work with most utility management systems including GE, Siemens, and ABB platforms. Implementation requires careful coordination to avoid service disruptions.

Robert: This sounds promising, but any changes to our grid systems require extensive regulatory approval and testing. What's your experience with utility regulations?

Hannah: We work closely with regulatory affairs teams and have experience with FERC, NERC, and state utility commission requirements. Implementation includes comprehensive testing phases.

Robert: After discussing this internally, the regulatory hurdles are too significant. Our compliance team estimates 18-24 months for approval, and we can't justify the risk and resource investment right now.

Hannah: I understand utility regulations are complex. Would you consider a smaller pilot that doesn't require full regulatory approval?

Robert: Unfortunately, even pilots require extensive documentation and approval. We'll need to pass on this opportunity for now.
