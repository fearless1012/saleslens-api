Transcript:
Michael: Lisa, thanks for making time. I know FinanceFirst has been dealing with increased fraud attempts lately.

Lisa: Unfortunately, yes. Our fraud losses increased 40% last year. Our current system catches obvious patterns but misses sophisticated attacks.

Michael: That's exactly what Llama 4's fraud detection addresses. It uses advanced pattern recognition to identify subtle anomalies that traditional rules-based systems miss. Community banks typically see 60-80% reduction in fraud losses.

Lisa: That would be significant for us. But false positives are also costly - we can't block legitimate transactions.

Michael: Absolutely. Our system actually reduces false positives by 50% compared to traditional systems. It learns your customers' normal behavior patterns and only flags truly suspicious activity.

Lisa: What about implementation? We can't have system downtime.

Michael: The implementation is seamless. We run parallel to your existing system for 30 days, then gradually transition. Zero downtime, and your team sees real-time comparisons of detection rates.

Lisa: This sounds promising. What about ongoing support and model updates?

Michael: We provide 24/7 monitoring and monthly model updates as fraud patterns evolve. Think of it as having a team of fraud experts working around the clock.

Lisa: I'd like to see a demo with our actual transaction data. Can we arrange that?

Michael: Absolutely. I'll coordinate with your IT team for a secure data demo next week.
