Transcript:
Emma: Hi Kevin, I'm reaching out because I know TrendCorp produces a lot of marketing content. Our AI can help scale your content creation significantly.

Kevin: Emma, I'll be honest - our creative team is already nervous about AI replacing human creativity. They're pretty resistant to the idea.

Emma: I understand that concern. Llama 4 isn't meant to replace creativity, but to enhance it. Think of it as a smart writing assistant that helps with first drafts, headlines, and variations.

Kevin: But our brand voice is very specific. We've spent years developing it. How can AI capture that nuance?

Emma: Great point. We train the model on your existing content to learn your brand voice, tone, and style. It becomes an extension of your team, not a replacement.

Kevin: That's interesting, but my team is already producing good work. I'm not sure they'd embrace this, and I can't force a tool on unwilling creatives.

Emma: What if we started with just data-driven tasks like A/B testing different headlines or social media variations?

Kevin: Look Emma, the technology might be impressive, but change management is my bigger challenge. My team needs to buy in, and right now they see AI as a threat, not a tool.

Emma: I completely understand. Team adoption is crucial for success.
