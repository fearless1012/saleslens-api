Transcript:
Sarah: Dr. Chen, thank you for your time. I know PharmaTech is working on innovative treatments and facing the typical 10-15 year development timelines.

Dr. Chen: Absolutely. We're particularly struggling with compound optimization and predicting molecular behavior early in the process.

Sarah: Llama 4's drug discovery module can analyze molecular structures and predict efficacy, toxicity, and side effects with 89% accuracy. We've helped biotech companies reduce discovery phases by 3-4 years.

Dr. Chen: That's impressive. What kind of data integration is required?

Sarah: We work with your existing molecular databases, clinical trial data, and research publications. The AI identifies promising compounds and eliminates dead ends early.

Dr. Chen: This sounds transformative. What's the investment?

Sarah: For a research facility your size, we're looking at $45K monthly with implementation costs around $30K.

Dr. Chen: I'm very interested, but our budget is tied up until next fiscal year. The board allocated funds elsewhere.

Sarah: I understand. Would you be open to a pilot program at reduced cost to demonstrate ROI for next year's budget?

Dr. Chen: Possibly. Send me some case studies and we'll revisit this in Q4.
