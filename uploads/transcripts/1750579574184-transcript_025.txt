Transcript:
Ashley: Daniel, thank you for meeting with me. I know GlobalTech has been navigating significant supply chain challenges in the electronics industry.

Daniel: That's an understatement. Chip shortages, shipping delays, geopolitical tensions - our supply chain is constantly disrupted. We need better visibility and risk management.

Ashley: Llama 4's supply chain optimizer analyzes supplier performance, geopolitical risks, weather patterns, and market conditions to predict disruptions weeks in advance. Electronics manufacturers typically reduce supply interruptions by 40% and cut inventory costs by 25%.

Daniel: How does it handle the complexity of electronics supply chains? We have thousands of components from hundreds of suppliers across dozens of countries.

Ashley: The AI maps your entire supply network, identifies critical path dependencies, and suggests alternative suppliers before disruptions occur. It even considers secondary and tertiary supplier risks.

Daniel: What about real-time monitoring and alerts?

Ashley: Continuous monitoring with instant alerts for potential disruptions. The system recommends specific actions like increasing orders from alternative suppliers or adjusting production schedules.

Daniel: This sounds exactly like what we need, but timing is challenging. We're in the middle of a major ERP system upgrade that won't be complete until Q1 next year.

Ashley: I understand. Supply chain integration does require stable systems. Would you consider a limited pilot with one product line using existing data feeds?

Daniel: Not really. Any new systems need to wait until our ERP stabilization is complete. The risk of disrupting current operations is too high.

Ashley: Completely understandable. May I follow up in Q2 2025 once your ERP implementation is stable?

Daniel: Yes, definitely. This conversation has been valuable, and I'd like to revisit this once we're through our current transition.
